# GameScepticalGo
Sceptical Go is a 2D puzzle game where you need to find your way in space among multiple planets and asteroids to reach the end of the level!

Your only mean of propulsion is to use the gravity of the planets around you to take the right turn at the right time. If you miss your shoot, you will be lost in space forever, wandering indefinitely...

Fortunately, you can place planets with different properties, as well as portals and other stars on your path to help and guide you towards the end of the level.
Find the right combination of planets to deviate your course and form a path in the big empty space so that you can land safely in your shelter! But pay attention to passing asteroids and other obstacles! You could crash into them and loose your spaceship!
